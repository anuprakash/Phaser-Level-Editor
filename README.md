Phaser-Level-Editor
===================
Starting to work on a simple level editor for the Phaser game engine.
At least for now, the output could work in just about any game engine.

This app is built with: 

- node-webkit (mostly for filesystem access)
- AngularJS (For easy databanding and overall MVC-ish architecture)
- FabricJS (seems a natural fit since it uses Canvas and Phaser can also use Canvas)
